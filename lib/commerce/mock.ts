      question: 'When is the best time to plant this mix in Texas?',
      answer: 'For Texas, plant between April and July when soil temperatures consistently reach 65Â°F or higher. This gives the warm-season grasses optimal conditions for germination.',

      question: 'How much water does this mix need during establishment?',
      answer: 'Keep soil consistently moist (not waterlogged) for the first 3-4 weeks. Water lightly 2-3 times daily until germination, then reduce to deep watering every 2-3 days.',

      question: 'Can horses graze immediately after planting?',
      answer: 'No, wait 60-90 days after planting before allowing horses to graze. The grass needs time to establish strong root systems to withstand traffic.',

      question: 'How does this compare to cool-season mixes?',
